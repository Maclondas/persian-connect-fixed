## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of Persian Connect seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure Process

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues privately by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@persian-connect.com`
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### 📧 What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue**: (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Depending on severity (1-14 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

### 🏆 Security Vulnerability Rewards

While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we do recognize security researchers who help us improve our security:

- **Public acknowledgment** in our security hall of fame
- **Special contributor badge** on your GitHub profile
- **Priority support** for any issues you encounter

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth** with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **JWT tokens** for session management
- **Role-based access control** for admin functions
- **Automatic logout** for inactive sessions

#### Data Protection
- **HTTPS enforced** for all communications
- **Environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **XSS protection** headers
- **CSRF protection** for forms

#### Payment Security
- **Stripe integration** (PCI DSS compliant)
- **No storage** of payment information
- **Webhook verification** for payment events
- **Test mode** separation from production

### Infrastructure Security

#### Hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
- **CDN protection** against DDoS
- **SSL/TLS certificates** auto-managed
- **Edge computing** for performance and security
- **Geographic distribution** of assets

#### Database (Supabase)
- **Row Level Security** policies
- **Connection pooling** for performance
- **Automatic backups** and point-in-time recovery
- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit

### Development Security

#### Code Quality
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Automated testing** (planned)
- **Dependency scanning** for vulnerabilities

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated builds** with security checks
- **Environment variable protection**
- **Secure deployment** processes
- **Version control** with signed commits

## 🔒 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Environment Variables
```bash
# ✅ Use for public configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...

# ❌ NEVER expose in client code
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
// ✅ Always validate user input
const sanitizedInput = input.trim().toLowerCase();
if (!isValidEmail(sanitizedInput)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid email format');
}

// ❌ Never trust user input directly
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${userInput}'`;
```

### API Security
```typescript
// ✅ Use proper authentication
const { data: user } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token);
if (!user) {
  return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
}

// ✅ Implement rate limiting
if (requestCount > RATE_LIMIT) {
  return new Response('Too many requests', { status: 429 });
}
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- **API keys** are public (Supabase anon key, Stripe publishable key)
- **RLS policies** protect data access at database level
- **Frontend validation** is for UX only, backend validation is authoritative

### Payment Security
- **Test mode** and **live mode** are completely separated
- **Webhook endpoints** verify Stripe signatures
- **No sensitive payment data** stored in our database

### Admin Functions
- **Admin privileges** are assigned via environment variables
- **Admin actions** are logged and auditable
- **Multi-factor authentication** planned for future releases

## 📋 Security Checklist for Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies enabled and tested
- [ ] Stripe webhooks configured with proper endpoints
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Security headers configured

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Authentication flow tested
- [ ] Payment processing tested (test mode)
- [ ] Admin functions properly restricted
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] All external links use proper security attributes

## 🔄 Security Updates

### Dependency Management
- **Automated dependency updates** via Dependabot
- **Security vulnerability scanning** in CI/CD
- **Regular security audits** of dependencies

### Security Monitoring
- **Error tracking** via application monitoring
- **Unusual activity detection** in logs
